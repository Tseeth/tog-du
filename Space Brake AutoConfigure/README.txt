This is an autoconfigure file and must be placed in your custom autoconf folder that should look something like this:

C:\ProgramData\Dual Universe\Game\data\lua\autoconf\custom

This script is configured on a standard pilot seat / command chair.

Once you've copied in the autoconfigure file, right click the pilot seat and select 'Advanced > Update custom autoconf list' once so Dual Universe recognizes the new file.  
Next, right click, select 'Advanced > Run custom autoconfigure > Flying Construct with Space Brake Panel'.
