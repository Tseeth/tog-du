REQUIREMENTS:
Pramming Board Controller (2)
Detection Zone (1) -- I use a large one as the mats are the same for all.  Size of zone determines area for activation.
Relay (1)
Sign(xs) (8) -- Larger signs may work however I developed and tested the sign placements on xs signs.
Containers (or Container Hubs) (8) -- One container or hub for each type of ore or pure metal.
 
The following two LUA files provide the scripts needed to have screens display the percentage and amount (in litres) for both ores and pure metal outputs.

A separate programming board will be used for ores and pures.  

You must establish a link from each container and each screen to the respective programming board. 

The links must be named as follows:

Ore Board:

Coal Container & Screen: container1/screen1
Hematite: container2/screen2
Bauxite: container3/screen3
Quartz: container4/screen4

Pure Board:

Carbon: container1/screen1
Iron: container2/screen2
Aluminium: container3/screen3
Silicon: container4/screen4

NOTE: The container data that DU provides is very limited.  You will need to edit both the ore display and the pure display and update the cont<#>maxvolume  (ie cont1maxvolume) variables to match the maximum volume you can store  in each container or container hub.

These scripts also assume that you only have these items by themselves in each container.  Things like oxygen/hydrogen will skew the liter counts.

The detection zone should be placed so that it's detection sphere covers the area in front of the signs, such that when a player walks up, the signs will activate.

The detection zone must be linked to the relay.  The relay then links to both programming boards.
