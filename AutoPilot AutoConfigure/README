This is an autoconfigure file and must be placed in your custom autoconf folder that should look something like this:

C:\ProgramData\Dual Universe\Game\data\lua\autoconf\custom

The AutoPilot is configured on a REMOTE CONTROLLER.

Once you've copied in the autoconfigure file, right click the remote controller and select 'Advanced > Update custom autoconf list' once so Dual Universe recognizes the new file.  
Next, right click, select 'Advanced > Run custom autoconfigure > Basic Space Autopilot'.

You cannot be operating your pilot seat when the remote controller is active and vice-versa.

Currently, the AutoPilot is SPACE ONLY and requires downward facing engines to help correct drift.   It lacks collision detection.  

It's recommended you already be on a general heading towards your destination before engaging autopilot.

This version of the autoconfigure includes the coordinates for the TOG Space Base.
